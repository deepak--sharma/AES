                school have access to a variety of resources. The goal of the school library media
                center is to ensure that all members of the school community have equitable access
                "to books and reading, to information, and to information technology.

                School timetables usually cycle every week or every fortnight. The phrase "school
                timetables" largely refers to high schools, because primary schools typically have
                trivially simple structures.
